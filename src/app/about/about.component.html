            The word <b>Coswara</b> is an amalgamation of Co (from corona) and Swara (sound in sanskrit). The project is
            being pursued in three stages:
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-title">Data Collection</h5>
        <p>
            We aim at creating a dataset composed of voice samples from healthy individuals, and those with COVID-19
            infection. The data is collected using a web and mobile application. Voice samples collected include
            breathing sounds (fast and slow), cough sounds (deep and shallow), phonation of sustained vowels (/a/ as in
            made, /i/,/o/), and counting numbers at slow and fast pace.
            Metadata information collected includes the participant's age, gender, location (country, state/ province),
            current health status (healthy/ exposed/ cured/ infected) and the presence of comorbidities (pre-existing
            medical conditions).
        </p>
        <p>
            No personally identifiable information is collected, and the data collection respects the privacy of the
            contributors.
            The data is also anonymized during storage itself. All the collected data will be available updated <a
                href="https://github.com/iiscleap/Coswara-Data">here</a> on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-title">Modeling</h5>
        <p>
            The collected data will be analysed using signal processing and machine learning techniques.
            The goal is to build mathematical models aiding identification of ‘infection prints’ from voice samples.
            This stage is a work-in-progress while we create the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also aim at releasing the collected dataset in a structured form openly via a Github platform.
            This is to pool effort from the larger research community to contribute in making point-of-care diagnosis a
            reality soon.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-title">Diagnostic Tool</h5>
        <p>
            We aim to release the diagnosis tool as a web/mobile application. Similar to the dataset creation stage, the
            application requests for recording the voice samples, and preferably provides a score indicating the
            probability of COVID-19 infection.
            The final deployment of the tool is subject to validation with clinical findings, and authorization/approval
            from competent authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the highly simplistic and cost effective nature of this diagnosis approach, we hypothesize that even a
            partial success of the tool would enable a massive deployment as a first line of diagnosis for the pandemic.
            The potential diagnostic tool will not replace chemical testing but merely supplement the existing testing
            methods.
