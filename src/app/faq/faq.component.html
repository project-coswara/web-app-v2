        <h5 class="question">How did you zero in on this particular idea?</h5>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                The idea of Coswara came about during the last week of March. Some of my colleagues that include fellow
                researchers and students started discussing the potential ways in which we can contribute to society in
                this unprecedented pandemic situation. The initial idea was to attempt modeling the pandemic using
                models that allow the prediction of the spread of the virus. However, understanding the symptoms of the
                disease made us realize that many of the prominent ones include respiratory disorders along with cough.
                Given that all of us in the group have a background in acoustics, audio and speech processing, we
                started thinking of ways in which our own research can help in developing a diagnostic tool for Covid.
                Reading and understanding prior research on detection of other respiratory illnesses like Pertussis,
                Pneumonia, Asthma and Tuberculosis enabled us to narrow down on a set of stimuli that can be potentially
                used for this work. Since the idea was to use the sounds (or swara in Sanskrit) to identify covid-19 we
                termed it as Coswara.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, understanding the current testing technology also motivated us further to develop this tool.
                The current approach is a chemical testing where a swab from the nose/throat of the subject is taken and
                the traits of the virus are amplified following a testing of the bio-molecular constituents of the
                virus. This testing process is very good in terms of the accuracy. However, it takes several hours and
                sometimes upto days to get the results depending on the number of tests and laboratory facilities. This
                chemical testing also involves trained doctors/nurses/healthcare workers to handle the swabs as well as
                the potential patients to walk into testing facilities violating social distancing. This can cause more
                infections and we have seen healthcare workers getting infected in many places including in our country.
                And the testing is quite expensive as the kits are imported from abroad. Our attempt is experimental,
                however if successful this can greatly simplify the testing with a contactless, fast and cost effective
                (very minimal cost) procedure. All one would need is access to a smartphone. Our intention is not to
                replace the current chemical testing, but to supplement it using this diagnostic tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, while we were developing this tool, we have come across other groups across the world from
                reputed universities like Carnegie Mellon in USA and Cambridge University in the UK which are attempting
                acoustic related testing. We have also come across an app based on cough sounds to detect Asthma and
                Pneumonia that has been approved as a tele-medicine tool in Australia. These developments across the
                world come across as potential proof of concept for our idea.

        <h5 class="question">How long will it take to develop this tool? Can you introduce us to the team members vis a
            vis their specialisation, expertise and experiences in their respective fields?</h5>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                The time to develop the tool is heavily dependent on the amount of data we get to build the tool. In
                other words, with active participation from the public and with some support of health authorities to
                get data from Covid patients, we can significantly accelerate the tool development process. The best
                case scenario would be a 2 month window in which we can roll out an early version of the tool. A
                clinical trial process would ensue where the tool will get thoroughly validated. This may take some time
                like a month. Once the technology is approved, it can be released to the general public. However, this
                work will still continue as we get more and more data and advance our research. Just like any other
                model based on Artificial Intelligence, they keep improving over time and get better. We anticipate a
                similar scenario for the Coswara tool as well.

        <h5 class="question">Please describe Coswara so a layperson understands it. In addition, please also tell us how
            it functions in detail.</h5>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                Coswara, the tool, is a really a webpage/app, that records some health status of the participant as well
                as sounds. Let us say that one is trying to book a railway ticket through an online portal or an app.
                There, the user would login, provide details of your travel and then make a payment. The result of this
                is a success or failure of booking. In the same manner, when the tool is fully functional, the
                participant provides some basic information about their current health conditions, and then records
                breathing sounds, cough sounds and speech sounds through the webpage. The entire process takes about 5
                minutes and does not record any personally identifiable information of the user. The result of our tool,
                would be a predictive number which provides a probability that the patient is infected with Covid-19.
                For example, if the user sees a score of 80%, then he/she must be proactive and go ahead to perform
                chemical testing. If a user is coming back to the tool and recording multiple times during the same day,
                the tool will also indicate how fast the symptoms are progressing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will again use an analogy to clarify this point. Many of us use smartphones to take pictures. And most
                of these smartphone cameras have a face detector which gives a bounding box around the face. Now, how
                did the camera capture automatically identify the face. It could identify the face by having a model
                trained on lots of images which were face and non-face. That model indeed learnt that the face has some
                particular features like the presence of eyes, nose and mouth which are quite different from other image
                portions. In a very similar fashion, the diagnostic tool in Coswara will attempt to identify the
                features of the breathing sounds, cough sounds and speech sounds that behave differently for a patient
                versus a normal healthy individual. The advantage of the tool is that the model in the tool would be
                able to learn the behavioral patterns from thousands of subjects and therefore has the potential to
                identify the specific patterns that are symptomatic of the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me try to suggest why this may help. Right now, some of us in the society may have a common cold, or
                a cough, or a fever. Or may think that we may have come in close proximity to a person having these
                conditions. Given the heightened anxiety, we would like to test ourselves for Covid-19 and make sure we
                are not infected. However, chemical testing for such a large population is not feasible given the
                time/money/effort involved in testing. In such a case, this tool allows the user to test at home using
                his/her own smartphone. If a high probability of infection is seen, then the same information can be
                shared with the healthcare facility or doctor and this can prioritize his/her chemical testing to truly
                confirm the presence of the virus. This way the tool would function as a pre-screening methodology.
                Again, we are not trying to replace existing methods but merely trying to supplement them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In detail, the way the tool would function is by identifying specific patterns in the audio data of
                speech sounds, cough sounds and breathing sounds. The prominent symptoms of Covid-19 include shortness
                of breath, dry cough and fever. Among these symptoms, our research is directed towards identifying if
                the breathing pattern of a healthy individual is different from the one that is infected with the virus.
                Similarly for cough sounds as well. We are also measuring the voice in the form of sustained phonation.
                In this case, the user is asked to sustain vowel sounds like /a/ for as long as possible. A person
                having shortness of breath or difficulty breathing cannot sustain his/her voice as long as a healthy
                patient. Added to this is a counting exercise. Our tool will ask the user to count from 1-20 in a normal
                manner and a fast manner. Again, subjects with respiratory disorders and breathing difficulties would
                have trouble speaking fast. On each of these distinct sound data, we will develop models that can
                separate the behavior of healthy versus patient subjects. Just like a trained doctor using sounds from
                the stethoscope to understand any respiratory tract infection, the tool will attempt to bucket the data
                into normal ones and abnormal ones. The tool has 9 stimuli and the indicators of the disease from all
                these stimuli would be combined to generate the final score.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5 class="question">At what stage are we currently in terms of the development of the tool? What is the next
            step?</h5>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                In the first stage, the participants in the study would give us their health conditions as well as their
                data of the different sounds by recording through their smartphone. In the second stage, this data will
                be pooled from all subjects and be placed under different buckets based on health conditions. Let us
                assume there are two buckets, one for normal subjects and one for patients. Once the data is placed in
                these two buckets, we will look for patterns in the data that are different across the two buckets. For
                example, if the cough sound from Covid +ve subject has a shrill sounding nature, we can separate this
                out and say that this is an indicator of the disease. Once these behavioral patterns are identified, the
                third stage is to build this diagnostic tool and verify its validity on a larger population.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, we are in the first stage, and this entire process is dependent on the data that the users
                are
                providing us in the first stage. We have submitted the proposal of this concept to Indian Council of
                Medical Research (ICMR) for approval. We have also alerted health authorities like the health
                secretaries of different states in the country about the tool. While we wait for these approvals, we
                encourage participants from the public both of healthy nature as well as from people with any illnesses
                including Covid-19. While the participation is voluntary, we will use this data only for experimental
                validation and later for a public release of the tool to the society at large. This way the data that
                participants are provided can enable more efficient testing and may indeed save lives. The more
                participation from the public, the better our chances are in developing this tool.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5 class="question">Please tell us the scope of application of Coswara</h5>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                The whole project is based on the assumption that there are sound biomarkers for the Covid-19 disease.
                This is indeed a hypothesis at this stage. We would like to highlight that we would only know the answer
                about the validity of this hypothesis once we get to build the model using the data provided by the
                participants. Let us look at the worst case scenario, if the hypothesis is false, meaning that the
                Covid-19 does not leave any biomarkers in sound, the data collected and research done in this work would
                still be very useful for identifying other respiratory illnesses in the future and as part of
                telemedicine technologies. And even in a partially successful case for the hypothesis, meaning that we
                are able to identify the presence of the disease using the tool, this would be a strong candidate as a
                front-line tool for pre-screening Covid-19. If prior history of tools developed for pneumonia,
                tuberculosis and pertussis are any indicators, we are fairly confident in attempting this diagnostic
                tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not foresee any negative impact for the participants in the study as it involves only 5 minutes of
                time. The participants are advised to use only their personal smartphone to record and to sanitize/wipe
                the device after recording. The recording is not stressful. It would be similar to talking on the phone
                for 5 minutes. We do not see any contamination by participating in the study. We do not record any
                identity of the participant or whereabouts to track/trace the subject. Also, as mentioned before, we are
                not looking for profits or money by developing this technology. All the data, with complete
                anonymization will be provided to other interested research groups across the globe to help their work
                in diagnostic tool development. We believe that sharing the data would increase the chance of success as
                well as the speed of technology development. Thus, if the cause of this effort makes sense, please visit
                coswara.iisc.ac.in and provide your data.
